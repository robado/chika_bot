## To-Do List
Ideas of function for this bot

* Welcome message on user joining

    * Either modify old one
        * By adding *brief* & *description* to *command()*
    * Or make a brand new one
* Add errors for necessary commands or actions
    * And error for every command/action would be great - but probably not necessary

* Role specific commands
    * For example admins have ban, kick. Mods could have rename
* Restrict on commands on channels
    * Restrict where specific commands can be used on which channels
* Add config file for config stuff
    * For example token

    * Either a specific one or a random??

    * It has a free plane for hobbyist!
    
## How to run locally
Running locally you need to Python 3.7, pip 20.0.2 and pipenv==2018.11.26. (These are the versions I used to make
 this bot, but probably with earlier version it would work).

### `Installing Python`  
Python you can download from [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### `Pip`  
Pip should come when you install Python. But if not for some reason you can install it via this [link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

### `pipenv`  
Pipenv can be installed via this [link](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#pragmatic-installation-of-pipenv)

### `Running bot locally`  
Finally when you have everything installed you can build this project and run locally. 
* This will be updated! Currently no instructions on how to run locally.

Firstly create a token.txt where you will store your bots token. This file is excluded from GitHub repository because
 bots have uniques tokens.
